Here's a list of credits for each individual mod added to this megamerge! This is not intended to replace the credits on the GitHub, in the discord server, or inside the game itself. This is more of a directory to find each mod in the official Clangen mod library!



*If you see your mod here and would like different/more credit or if your mod is misattributed, please join my mod server and reach out to me! (https://discord.gg/2nmzFUjC8A)*



**To follow each link you must be apart of the Official Clangen Discord Server (https://discord.gg/clangen)**
